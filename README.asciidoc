= JDG as a Service

This very short demo installs JDG with cross site replication in
 3 different clusters (or just namespaces):

```
Stage
  +-- Stage Namespace --+
AWS                     |
  +-- AWS Namespace     + Replication
Azure                   |
  +-- Azure Namespace --+
```

All three clusters work in active-active-active replication so please be aware that:

* You should not write into the same key from different namespaces or clouds
* Replication is Async, so it may take same time

== How to run it?

* Have a look at `group_vars/clouds` file and edit server addresses and tokens.
**  It is absolutely fine to use `oc cluster up`. Just use 3 different namespaces there.
** The user needs to be able to create a Load Balancer Services.
* Once you edited the file, just execute `./run.sh`.

== Next steps

* [ ] Add some more granularity to the playbooks
* [ ] Always login to different clusters the same way
* [ ] Prepare living installation
